            <p style="text-align: center">
                The Armlys Clan faces war against a foreign enemy. The worst is feared and Vagrient's due return has come to a sudden halt.
                The warpgate's connection that links the distant solar system where he is currently located and his home system has been corrupted.
                Restoring power to the connection would again allow for warp travel however, it comes at a cost. It requires a substantial amount of an
                extremely rare energy source. Vagrient has only one clear option and that is to search for the energy. The planet that he is stranded
                on does contain other active gates, connecting local planets of the solar system. This entire system has been considered uncharted
                territory by his clan for many years other than the routine visits that occur to the planet he currently stands on. Returning home is top
                priority but the tasks at hand are unknown...
