                About Me & The Development
            </h3>
            <p style="text-align: center">
                Hello everyone and thank you for taking interest in my upcoming video game. The development of VAGRIENT began at the end
                of 2022 and is on a two year development plan. This is the first game that I have ever created and have had no prior game dev
                experience in the past. Up until this large project began, I was basically just skilled at drawing. Throughout the development, I
                have expanded my knowledge and learnt new skills which has allowed me to produce everything required for the game. These
                new skills, such as drawing game ready art, animating, sound editing, composing music, coding etc. has been a steep learning
                curve yet very enjoyable!<br>
                <br>
                I have always been a passionate gamer throughout my life, tracking back to playing old favourite titles like the original Diablo and Legacy
                of Kain: Soul Reaver to name a couple. More recent titles include Escape from Tarkov and EVE Online. The time had come to
                create something of my own when a close friend had inspired me to take on such a task. I have been fortunate enough that my
                brother in law has taken the time to assist me in learning how to code and lastly my wife who has been extremely supportive of
                me and my project.
